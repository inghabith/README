Hi there, I'm so glad you're here, Im Habith, I'm a civil engineer trying to enter in the web development world!
I'm a web developer in training in riwi.
Im currently learning about python and how to work in a collaborative enviroment using the platform GitHub to share my projects with other collaborators and azure DevOps to manage and coordinate diffrent projects. 
I'm very passionate about baseball, I like to play every weekend and I'm so proud to say that I'm a the best centerfield!, I'm very interested in learning how to play violin.
